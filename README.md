# YouTube and Instagram Video Downloader

This is a simple Streamlit-based web application that allows users to download videos from **YouTube** and **Instagram**. The app uses `yt-dlp` for YouTube downloads and `Instaloader` for Instagram.

## Features
- Download **YouTube** videos by URL using `yt-dlp`.
- Download **Instagram** posts and stories using `Instaloader`.
- Built with **Streamlit** for easy-to-use web interface.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- **`yt-dlp`**: A more powerful fork of `youtube-dl` for downloading YouTube videos.
- **`Instaloader`**: A library to download Instagram posts, stories, and profiles.
- **`Streamlit`**: The framework used to build the interactive web app.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the app locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-insta-video-download.git
cd youtube-insta-video-download
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
Create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the necessary libraries such as `yt-dlp`, `instaloader`, and `streamlit`.

### 4. Run the App Locally
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will start, and you should be able to open it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
